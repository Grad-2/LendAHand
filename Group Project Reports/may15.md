This week we laid out our groundwork for the project and setup our initial work. We had a meeting where we discussed our SQL schema and some other topics to ensure we were all on the same page and our work would be aligned.

Standups

Taylor - Frontend

This week I created the initial landing page layout with an appbar and some buttons. I also added some initial pages for Lend, Request, Profile, and Login. I took Login a bit further adding a form to fill out. Currently it just console logs the info in the form and displays “Hello [inserted name] !”.
